1.  Copy the 'vehicles/' folder into your project folder:

    cp -r django-vehicles/vehicles/ <project>/vehicles

2.  Add 'vehicles' to INSTALLED_APPS in <project>/settings.py

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django.contrib.auth',
        [...]
        'vehicles',
    )

3.  Run 'python manage.py syncdb' to load all the vehicle information into your database
4.  Include the vehicles urls in your urls.py

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        [...]
        (r'^vehicles/', include('vehicles.urls')),
    )

5.  Copy vehicles/static/selector.js to your media directory.

    mkdir <MEDIA>/vehicles
    cp vehicles/static/selector.js <MEDIA>/vehicles/selector.js

6.  If you chose to include 'vehicles.urls' in a path other than 'vehicles', you will also have to
update the first line of selector.js to reflect that.

    var VEHICLE_ROOT = "/<Your Vehicles Path>/";

7.  To use a CarModel in one of your application's models, just include a ForeignKey to vehicles.models.CarModel:

    from vehicles.models import CarModel
    class YourClass(models.Model):
        car_model = models.ForeignKey(CarModel)

8.  When you create a ModelForm for your model, just use a vehicles.forms.CarModelField for the correct property

    from models import YourClass
    from vehicles.forms import CarModelField

    class YourClassForm(forms.ModelForm):
        car_model = CarModelField()

        class Meta:
            model = YourClass

9. Finally, when you include your form in a template, you must also include {{ form.media }} so that the vehicle selector
javascript files are included.

    <form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="POST">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <input type="submit"/>
    </form>
    {{ form.media }}
